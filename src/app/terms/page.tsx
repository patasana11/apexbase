        <p>
          These Terms of Service constitute a legally binding agreement made between you and ApexBase ("we," "us," or "our"),
          concerning your access to and use of our website and services.
        </p>
        <p>
          You agree that by accessing the Service, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these
          Terms of Service. If you do not agree with all of these Terms of Service, then you are expressly prohibited
          from using the Service and you must discontinue use immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
          We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or modifications to these Terms of Service at
          any time and for any reason. We will alert you about any changes by updating the "Last updated" date of these
          Terms of Service, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each such change.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">2. Services</h2>
        <p>
          ApexBase provides a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform with features including but not limited to: authentication and
          user management, database storage, serverless functions, API management, workflow automation, file storage,
          and analytics. The Service is subject to availability and may be modified, updated, or discontinued at any time.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">3. Subscriptions</h2>
        <p>
          Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a recurring
          and periodic basis (monthly or annually), depending on the subscription plan you select.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of each period, your subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless
          you cancel it or we cancel it. You may cancel your subscription by contacting our customer support team.
        </p>
        <p>
          A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the payment for your subscription.
          You shall provide us with accurate and complete billing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, we will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you
          must proceed manually, within a certain deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">4. Free Trial</h2>
        <p>
          We may, at our sole discretion, offer a subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time. You may
          be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the free trial.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do enter your billing information when signing up for a free trial, you will not be charged by us until
          the free trial has expired. On the last day of the free trial period, unless you canceled your subscription,
          you will be automatically charged the applicable subscription fee for the type of subscription you have selected.
        </p>
        <p>
          At any time and without notice, we reserve the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the free trial
          offer, or (ii) cancel such free trial offer.
        </p>
